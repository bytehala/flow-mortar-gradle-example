Made this as an easy way to play with flow and mortar example using Android Studio.

Due to the fast development of flow and mortar in recent weeks, this project has become stale. Will update it using the gradle artifacts by Square when I get the time, if still necessary. I'm hoping their libraries are now easier to use than when I made this, that's better for everyone.
